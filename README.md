# UnoTestApp02_Metronome
This project is a learning project for Uno Platform & firebase hosting.

# Learned Points
・After you edit shared XAML files, if you want to debug UWP projects in Uno Platform,  you should build the UWP projects before that.

・

# Problems
・I still can only run UWP & Wasm Projects. How do I run other projects?

・How do I linking Firebase and GitHub in Uno Platform projects? (probably, I have to use MSBuild in GitHub Actions?)
